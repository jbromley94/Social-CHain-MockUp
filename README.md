# jb-northcoder-news

## Getting Started

Hello,
You have made it to the README for my app- Northcoders News.
Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Think something along the lines of Reddit.

This app uses my existing API - [jb-northcoder-news](https://jb-northcoder-news.herokuapp.com/).
This app is the front-end to this API.

### Installing

To acquire the files you shall have to use this snippet in the command line, make sure that you have cd'd into the directory you wish to clone into :

```
git clone https://github.com/jbromley94/FE2-NC-News.git
```

Below lays out the npm installs one shall have to use to get the app up and running.

### Prerequisites

To use this program you will have to run the following, this is provided you have set up your npm and git environments, as well as cd'ing into the clone directory

For all npm packages needed just run :

```
npm install
```

The versions are as follows :

````
    "react": "^16.6.3",
    "react-dom": "^16.6.3",
    "react-player": "^1.7.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^4.3.1",
    "react-scripts": "2.1.1"
    ```

The final task to carry out will be to run the app by typiing the following command into your terminal, given you have navigated to the correct directory:

npm start
````
